# Slot Machine
 
This is a simple console-based Python slot machine game. The user begins with a starting balance of £100 and can place bets on the slot machine. After placing a bet, the slot machine "spins" and displays a row of three random symbols. If all three symbols match, the user wins an amount based on the type of symbol, with different symbols offering different payouts. The game continues as long as the player has money, and they can choose to "sell their soul" for more spins if they run out of balance.
